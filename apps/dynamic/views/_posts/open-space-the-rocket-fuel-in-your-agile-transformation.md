Although stating the rules is an important part of making an open-space event work, there are a few other fundamental tips for a facilitator to be aware of in order for the event to be a success. I’d be happy to go through these with you (or whoever will be the facilitator) on a call if you’d like.

As for the “rules", I’ve seen them described most often as five principles, and one law.

The five principles are:
- Whoever comes are the right people. Whether you have 80 people at your session, 8, don’t waste time wishing someone else was there. Those people are the people who care the most about this topic, so work with them. Even if you end up with nobody in your session, you’ll have some time to yourself to think about the topic and work on it.
- Whenever it starts is the right time. Spirit and creativity do not run on the clock.
- Where you are is the right place. Reminds participants to always be aware of what’s going on around them. Perhaps you meant to go to a session right now but you’re already in an interesting conversation right there. Then stay where you are!
- When it’s over, it’s over. Don’t stick to the timetable - if the conversation has finished ahead of schedule, use the law of two feet and go find someplace else to contribute.
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have - prepare to be surprised! - reminds participants not to fret about what might have been. Make the most of what’s happened, and expect that things will not go according to plan.

The law:

Some other important tips for a facilitator to bear in mind:

0) Pre-work
1) Create a sense of safety
2) Warm up
3) Close down
4) Use a theme
5) Work with the space

I’ll expand on these:

Pre-work
Before the event, prime the audience several times by email (or any other method at hand) to get them ready for what to expect. Do this by:

- ensuring people have to apply to attend by answering a series of topic-related questions
- sending round information about the principles of open-space, and any quotes or other communications from previous events
- sending round the session leader guide (attached) with encouragement to lead a session

Creating a sense of safety
The magic that makes an open space event work is when people there feel empowered to speak their minds and follow their hears about where they can offer the most meaningful contribution. Psychology research tells us that many people do not start out their typical working day feeling in such a relaxed and open frame of mind. So it’s up to the facilitator to engender this feeling in the attendees.

But how?

Explicitly state that you want people to feel safe. Tell them that they can leave their roles at the door, and that everyone here is an equal. If you’re concerned that psychological safety may be an issue, create an anonymous suggestion box (a pile of index cards and a cardboard box with a hole in it would do) where people can tell you what you can do to make them feel more relaxed. Often just making this offer will help people to feel more relaxed, even if they never take you up on it.

Warm up
As the facilitator, try to start the event off by getting people on their feet and doing something connected with the purpose of the event that will get them talking. I often use “sole mates” (find the person in the room with the shoes most like yours) but you can insert any good game here that gets people into groups of two-three, and ask them to share one expectation or hope for the event, or some other topic-related question.

Close down
At the end of the day, make sure to get everyone back in a circle and give them a chance to share what they’ve experienced. Many people will feel they’ve missed out on a lot of the conversations (you’ll have had at least 3-4 going on in parallel all day) so this is their chance to come back together and share those different experiences. Make the most of that.

As the facilitator, you can try to use the ‘focussed conversation method’ to guide the closing circle towards actions. I like to ask every individual to write down one action on a card, and take it away with them.

Use a theme
Having a theme or framing question (e.g. “How can we best maximise the number of teams who get the benefits of ATDD?”) helps people beforehand when thinking about proposing sessions, and also helps to keep the session topics somewhat coherent. People will always have their off-topic axes to grind and that’s fine - whoever comes are the right people - but using a topic will help most of the sessions to be around that topic. Do your research beforehand to choose a theme that seems to be the most pressing one for the group you want to work with. Use the theme in your pre-work.

Work with the space
Another magic ingredient in open-spaces is the spaces themselves. The diverse character of the individual spaces can attract and encourage different kids of sessions, so make the most of the different strengths and weaknesses of each one. Some will have a screen and be great for presentations or coding exercises, some will be more suited to a discussion. Make that clear on your agenda, and try to help people post their sessions in the appropriate space. Look for unofficial spaces in corridors that could be used for smaller discussion tracks.

I hope that helps. [Speak to me](TODO) if you’d like an experienced Cucumber facilitator to lead one of these events in your company.

"the open space was a really new idea for LIT, and we have all come away invigorated and eager to get involved in our transformation!
 
I am specially pleased that my presentation went down really well with some important people, and I am now helping to design some in-house experimentation around continuous improvement initiatives."

"Super two days, great format and fantastic outcome. People talking collaborating and sharing ideas. Thank you, thankyou, thank you!!"
